# SDL C++ Game Engine

This is a personal project where my goal is to create a simple 2D videogame engine that relies mostly in the SDL library. My motivations to create my own engine are to practice my coding skills and to avoid using distractful engines like Unity that have more features that simpler videogames might never use. After finishing the engine and UI I plan on starting on the development of a videogame.
